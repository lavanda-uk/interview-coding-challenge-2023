# SETUP:

1. Using the file in `data/file.txt` (you can use `wget` - after this you’ll have a new `file.txt` file in the local working directory)
2. Execute `wc data/file.txt`
3. Execute `man wc` to get acquainted with the `wc` command, if you don’t know it
4. Design an API endpoint that receives a file/text and returns `wc` response

# EXERCISE:

Write a ruby program that implements the same behaviour as `wc file.txt`
